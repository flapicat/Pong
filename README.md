# Pong
Pong is old arcade game that I recreate with OpenGL and freetype.
This is my first ever comleted game so code is basically garbage with a lot of bugs.

# Building and running
Officially support Windows 10/11 and visual studio 2022.
1. Clone repository
2. Run `generate.bat`
3. Open Pong.sln and hit F5
